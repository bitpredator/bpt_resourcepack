Script FiveM Copyright (C) 2022 bitpredator

HELPFULL INFO:
* I decided to merge all my scripts into one package to make it easier to work and download resources.
* Each script has its own README file its own LICENSE, make sure you READ it so you know how to install everything



Scripts moved to this package:
* [bpt_crafting]( https://github.com/bitpredator/bpt_crafting )
* [bpt_ammujob]( https://github.com/bitpredator/bpt_ammujob )
